        <h2>Drawing a Realistic Ice Cube</h2>
        <p>
          For the purposes of this tutorial, I encourage you to follow my own
          drawing closely. But if you think you can manage with more freedom,
          try!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 1 - Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          This step is often overlooked, even by yours truly, but should at
          least be given some consideration to avoid disaster. Find some good
          references, a comfortable location, good lighting and a flat surface
          without excess dust or breadcrums. Get ready one or a few pieces of
          paper, pencils of varying hardness, a sharpener and a good eraser. If
          you only have bad erasers that smudge out everything, just forget it
          and bring more papers and patience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 2 - Planning and contour</h3>
        <p>
          This is the most important step - proceed with caution. Decide where
          to put the visible corners of the ice cube and
          <u>carefully</u> mark them out. Trying to keep track of the hidden
          corners as well could be useful for increased accuracy, but is highly
          difficult and confusing. As such, I have decided to avoid it. If it
          looks good, gently draw lines connecting them. If it looks a little
          off, try first to pinpoint the error and then experiment by slightly
          adjusting the position of the points until it looks good. If you are
          having trouble, experiment on another piece of paper, draw out the
          lines, compare with referneces and consider the possibility that it
          does in fact not look all that bad.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you draw the lines, you can add the bumps, curves and
          imperfections characteriztic to the shape of an ice cube immedeately
          if you wish, rather than doing it later, as it follows what you might
          expect quite closely. And do not forget to round the corners! The word
          "ice cube" is misleading.

        <p>
          Form a few unique areas where the shade, shape or texture will differ
          notably. Begin with large shapes like the dark areas (often located at
          the center) and highlights (often going along edges in quite thin
          strips). Move on to cracks and areas with many things going on. Rather
          than trying to add small reflective details everywhere, make areas for
          them and add <u>a few</u> small extra details afterwards.
